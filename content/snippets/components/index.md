Stylify components are inspired by the [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/).

Components' proportions are taken from their [community figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/DJMWYdOn4HyZ9GQqrGZfXD/Material-3-Design-Kit-(Community)?node-id=47909%3A2).

<note><template>
	Components expect that you have some kind of a "reset" stylesheet included in your page.
	For example [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).
	Also the `box-sizing:border-box` should be added on all elements.
